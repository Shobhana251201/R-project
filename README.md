**Objective**
To able to anticipate potential churns who are about to abandon the  services by analyzing their behavior patterns.

**Methodology**
1. Load the dataset (CSV file)
2. Calculate number of employees that leave each year irrespective of the department.
3. Find in which department the  termination is maximum.
4. plot type of terminations – voluntarily/Involuntarily.
5. Pot the reason for voluntary and involuntary terminations department wise.
6. Plot the decision tree.
7. Calculate prediction probabilites of employees who will resign.
Test different models and compare the accuracy. 

**Algorithms used**
In this project I compared 2 models : 
1. Random forest ( Model accuracy - 0.923)
2. Gradient Boost model (  Model accuracy – 0.8768)

**Conclusion**
Since, the accuracy of Random forest model is more after comparing, I considered the results of this model.
